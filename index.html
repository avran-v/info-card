        <p> Hi, I'm Keerthi, a 2nd year CS student at Georgia Tech! <br> <br> 
            In the realm of <span class="emphasis">social good</span>, I'm most interested in the field of education. 
            I've been volunteering and teaching CS in several ways in the past few years, through Girls Who Code and Kode with Klossy. 
            I'm also involved in education research regarding instructor language and how it can impact student learning. 
            I'd love to <span class="emphasis">improve the learning experience for students</span> in the future, helping them gain self-confidence.
        <p> Let's connect!</p>
